abstract={As part of an integrated study of the ecology of freshwater riverine turtle communities in the southern United States, we analyzed food resource partitioning in the turtle communities of the Cahaba, Chickasawhay, and Pearl rivers. We collected turtles with an array of unbaited fyke nets for periods of 10 d from 1 July to 13 August 1978 and 30 April to 4 August 1979, capturing 2707 turtles of 16 species in 2428 trap days. We successfully flushed the stomach contents from 729 turtles of the following species: Apalone mutica, Apalone spinifera, Graptemys flavimaculata, Graptemys gibbonsi, Graptemys nigrinoda, Graptemys oculifera, Graptemys pearlensis, Graptemys pulchra, Pseudemys concinna, Sternotherus carinatus, Sternotherus peltifer, and Trachemys scripta. We also caught 4 other species in low numbers: Chelydra serpentina, Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii, Macrochelys temminckii, and Sternotherus odoratus. Stomach contents were identified and quantified by volume and percentage of occurrence for each species from each river. Food items were identified and placed in 6 categories: crustaceans, insects, mollusks, fish, plants, and unidentified. Pseudemys concinna was the most specialized feeder at all 3 sites, feeding almost exclusively on plants, followed by the wide-headed Graptemys and then narrow-headed Graptemys. Specialist species tended to show extensive niche overlap with any other species that consumed a large proportion of the specialists' preferred foods. © 2020 Chelonian Research Foundation.},

funding_text 1={The great disparity in time from the collection of these data to finally submitting the manuscript resulted from the senior author’s untimely death and from R.C.V. moving three times in the last 40 yrs from Carnegie Museum of Natural History (CMNH) to Estacion de Biologia Tropical Los Tuxtlas in Veracruz, Mexico, to Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia in Manaus, Brazil. This is the first in a series of six papers that are being prepared from this study, which was funded by US Fish and Wildlife Service and the O’Neil and Netting Funds from Carnegie Museum of Natural History. Permits were authorized to conduct these studies by the state governments of Alabama and Mississippi to R.C.V. All specimens collected during the study were either released at the site of capture or preserved and deposited in CMNH. No ethics permit was issued for this study—while we had ethics in 1978, we were not required to prove it at that time. Turtles were captured and handled according to the Guidelines for Herpetological Research published by the American Society of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists (Beaupre et al. 2004). We thank A. Bianculi, M. Christiansen, P. Freed, Caroline Sue, Alicia Cornejo, the Zaner Brothers, the social club of the Leakesville Landing, Cupcake, David Cook, and J. Jacobs for field assistance during different parts of the study. Guta and Rodrigo are thanked for updating the tables to a 21st century format. O.A.F.V. thanks General Directorate of Academic Personal Affairs– Autonomous National University of Mexico (DGAPA-UNAM) for support during his tenure at Carnegie Museum and the authorities of Carnegie Museum for support, E. Censky, S. Thomson, R. Davidson, Maryann and Steve Rogers, and Chen. We thank B. Buttler for English corrections and comments. We would like to dedicate this article to the memory of Jack McCoy—a great mentor, father, friend, and turtle biologist. Although he is no longer with us, his memory and dedication to field studies stimulates us to go on forever or at least until the end of time.},

abstract={Sternotherus carinatus (Razorback Musk Turtle) is an aquatic species for which natural history information is lacking. We explored natural history differences between males and females using analyses of sexual dimorphism, movement patterns, and diets in 2 East Texas populations. We found male-biased sexual dimorphism in both head and body size, a pattern partially consistent with analyses of preserved museum specimens. Using radiotelemetry, we found no differences between males and females in home ranges, maximum distance moved, and total distance moved. However, females exhibited significantly higher mean daily speeds. Analysis of the proportional use of food resources indicated a high degree of overlap between males and females and a low degree of overlap between populations. The selective forces influencing the observed patterns of sexual dimorphism in this species remain unclear but our data seem to rule out partitioning of food resources. © 2016 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

abstract={Diets of freshwater turtles often reflect the availability of food resources in the environment. accordingly, bottomfeeding turtles' diets are typically composed of benthic macroinvertebrate fauna (e.g., insects and mollusks). However, the composition of benthic systems has changed because many freshwater ecosystems have been invaded by non-native species, including bivalve species such as the asian clam, corbicula fluminea. i studied the diet of Sternotherus carinatus, the Razorbacked Musk Turtle, in southeastern oklahoma across three zones of corbicula abundances: no corbicula, moderate corbicula densities, and high corbicula densities. i hypothesized that the composition of corbicula in the diet would increase with increased abundance of corbicula in the riverine environment. Turtles were caught by snorkel surveys in the little and Mountain fork rivers and kept overnight for the collection of fecal samples. The diet was similar to that found in previous studies on S. carinatus except that corbicula is a new component of the diet and composed the majority of the diet in high-density corbicula areas. an index of Relative importance (iRi) showed that corbicula was the most important prey item in the areas with high corbicula density, was equally as important as gastropods in the areas with moderate corbicula density, and was absent from the diet in areas without corbicula. as indicated by a non-metric dimensional scaling ordination, the diet of turtles in the areas without corbicula was more diverse, containing insects, crayfish, gastropods, unionids, and seeds in high proportions. My data suggest that the diet of S. carinatus has become more molluscivorous and diet diversity has been reduced as the result of the presence of corbicula. © 2013. Carla Atkinson.

abstract={Reproduction in female razorback musk turtles, Sternotherus carinatus, from southeastern Oklahoma and central Arkansas was examined. At both sites ovulation apparently occurs from late April or early May to at least early July, with 2 or 3 clutches typically produced per year. Arkansas females grow faster than Oklahoma females, reach maturity at larger sizes (95-100 versus 85-90 mm carapace length) but younger ages (after 5-6 versus 8 winters), reach larger adult sizes (mean carapace length 117 versus 102 mm), produce heavier eggs (5.7 versus 5.2 g), and bigger (3.8 versus 2.3 eggs) and heavier clutches (21.6 versus 11.6 g). For both populations, clutch size increases with body size; egg size also increases with body size, but the relationship is weaker. Unstandardized egg and clutch size exhibit no clear relationship; however, when effects of body size are removed, egg size and clutch size are negatively correlated. Clutch mass relative to body mass does not differ between sites, but relative egg size is greater in Oklahoma.},

abstract={North American turtles hatch in late summer and spend their first winter either on land or underwater. Adaptations for terrestrial overwintering of hatchlings in northern regions, where winter thermal and hydric regimes are harsh, have not been systematically investigated in many species. We measured intrinsic supercooling capacity, resistance to inoculative freezing, and desiccation resistance in hatchlings of terrestrial and aquatic turtles collected from northern (Terrapene ornata, Chrysemys picta bellii, Kinosternon flavescens, Chelydra serpentina) and southern (Chrysemys picta dorsalis, Trachemys scripta, Sternotherus odoratus, Sternotherus carinatus) locales. Supercooling capacity was estimated from the crystallization temperature of turtles cooled in the absence of external ice nuclei. Mean values ranged from -8.1° to -15.5°C and tended to be lower in terrestrial hibernators. Inoculation resistance was estimated from the crystallization temperature of turtles cooled in a matrix of frozen soil. These values (range of means: -0.8° to -13.6°C) also tended to be lower in the terrestrial hibernators, especially C. picta bellii. Mean rates of evaporative water loss varied markedly among the species (0.9-11.4 mg g-1 d-1) and were lowest in the terrestrial hibernators. Most species tolerated the loss of a modest amount of body water, although half of the sample of S. carinatus died from desiccation. In general, turtles did not regain lost body water from wet soil, and immersion in free water was required for rehydration. Therefore, desiccation resistance may be an important adaptation to terrestrial hibernation. Resistances to inoculative freezing and desiccation were directly correlated, perhaps because they are governed by the same morphological characteristics.},

abstract={An electrophoretic comparison of 15 proteins is used to evaluate genetic relationships. Samples of S. odoratus were highly heterozygous, but relatively little heterogeneity was seen among populations. Results confirm the previously reported affinity between S. minor and S. depressus. The genetic position of S. carinatus does not agree with ecological and morphological data placing it in a species complex with S. minor and S. depressus. Based on shared alleles and genetic distances, it appears that S. odoratus and S. carinatus are closer phylogenetically than either is to S. depressus or to S. minor. -Authors},
